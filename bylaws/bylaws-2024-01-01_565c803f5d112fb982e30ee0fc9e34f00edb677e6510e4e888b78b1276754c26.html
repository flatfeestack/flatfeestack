<h2>Structure and Organization</h2>
<h3>Art. 4 Bodies</h3>
<p>FlatFeeStack DAO's bodies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Council Member (&quot;Vorstand&quot;);</li>
<li>Ballot Vote (&quot;Urabstimmung&quot;);</li>
</ul>
<h3>Art. 5 General Concept of Competences and Duties</h3>
<p>The objective of FlatFeeStack DAO is to establish a decentralized and democratic association with flat hierarchies.
Therefore, the Council Member (&quot;Vorstand&quot;) will have only competences that require the action of an individual, natural person,
such as representation duties or the duty to keep the books.</p>
<p>The Ballot Vote (&quot;Urabstimmung&quot;) has elementary competences that are mandatory stipulated for an association assembly
by Swiss law (such as the change of bylaws, the liquidation of the association, and others). The Ballot Vote will be held digital.
Additionally, the Ballot Vote shall be the body, which can decide about the &quot;daily business&quot; such as the proposal and
support of projects and the funding allocation to projects. The Ballot Vote provides a blockchain-based technical infrastructure
to efficiently, democratically and transparently propose and vote.</p>
<h3>Art. 6 Underlying Technology</h3>
<p>FlatFeeStack DAO is technically built with Ethereum Smart Contracts. All voting will take place on this technical infrastructure.
The relevant technical functions are hereinafter written in italic. To be able to vote, holding a certain amount of Ether is
necessary for every member (transaction fees, gas fees).</p>
<h3>Art. 7 Council Member (Vorstand)</h3>
<p>FlatFeeStack DAO has at minimum 3 council members with the following competencies and duties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Representing FlatFeeStack DAO to the outside world;</li>
<li>Keeping the books and creating the necessary financial statements of FlatFeeStack DAO;</li>
<li>Canceling a Ballot Vote with at least 2 Council Member signatures, if they have a good reason for it (<code>cancelVotingSlot</code>);</li>
<li>Executing contract calls on official orders by governmental authorities with at least 2 Council Member signatures.</li>
<li>Reviewing member applicants on their eligibility to join FlatFeeStack DAO.
If the member meets the requirements of Art. 11, the Council Member will add their addresses to the member registry (<code>approveMembership</code>);</li>
<li>Remove Members who haven't paid their membership fees (<code>removeMembersThatDidntPay</code>);</li>
<li>Keeping the member registry (name, address, e-mail);</li>
</ol>
<p>The term of office for the Council Member starts with the foundation of this FlatFeeStack DAO and ends when the Council Member has been
replaced via a proposal. If a Council Member becomes unable to act or loses his private key, the Council Member or its address must
be replaced with a new Council Member in the next Ballot Vote. If all the Council Members are unable to act, an extraordinary Ballot Vote
will be called and two new Council Members must be elected. The personal liability of a Council Member is limited to cases of
gross negligence.</p>
<h3>Art. 8 Ballot Vote (&quot;Urabstimmung&quot;)</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Competences:
The Ballot Vote shall be the highest governing body of FlatFeeStack DAO.
The objective of the Ballot Vote is to allow every member to propose new projects and to vote on the funding allocation to those projects.
The Ballot Vote has the duty of collecting all the votes on the proposals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Voting Process:
The whole voting process is purely digital and blockchain based.
The members have one day to vote for every proposal in the Ballot Vote.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Voting Majorities:
Resolutions shall be adopted by a simple majority of the members participating at the individual Ballot Vote.
At least 1/5 of the Members must vote on a proposal and a simple majority to become successful.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Election Process for Council Member:
Any member can propose themselves for candidacy as a council member (<code>propose</code> &amp; <code>addCouncilMember</code>).
If the proposal is successful the new Council Member term starts at the execution of the proposal.
Any member can also propose to remove a council member (<code>propose</code> &amp; <code>removeCouncilMember</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Convocation:
The Ballot Vote can be held in regular slots. The duration of a slot is 14 days and after 14 days, the slot
finishes and a new slot opens. There is no Ballot Vote in a slot if no proposal is submitted.
The Council Member will inform the members electronically on the date, which is 7 days prior to the slot end.
A Ballot Vote lasts one full day. Since every member can propose a Ballot Vote, no extraordinary Ballot Vote is necessary.
After a successful vote, the execution get delayed until the end of the slot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Proposals &amp; Agenda Items:
Every member can submit a proposal. The contract execution via the Ballot Vote is binding and technically
non-reversible – not even by the Council Member. However, at least 2 Council Member signatures can cancel
a proposal before its execution, if they have a good reason. Proposals from members must be submitted at least
5 days prior to the Ballot Vote starting slot using the specific proposal function (<code>propose</code>).</p>
