<h3>Art. 2 Domicile</h3>

<h3>Art. 3 Purpose</h3>

<h2>Structure and Organization</h2>
<h3>Art. 4 Bodies</h3>
<p>FlatFeeStack DAO's bodies are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Council Member (&quot;Vorstand&quot;);</li>
<li>Ballot Vote (&quot;Urabstimmung&quot;);</li>
</ul>
<h3>Art. 5 General Concept of Competences and Duties</h3>
<p>The objective of FlatFeeStack DAO is to establish a decentralized and democratic association with flat hierarchies. Therefore, the Council Member (&quot;Vorstand&quot;) will have only competences that require the action of an individual, natural person, such as representation duties, managing financial records, or complying with governmental orders.</p>
<p>The Ballot Vote (&quot;Urabstimmung&quot;) has elementary competences that are mandatory stipulated for an association assembly by Swiss law (such as the change of bylaws, the liquidation of the association, and others). The Ballot Vote will be held digital. Additionally, the Ballot Vote shall be the body, which can decide about the &quot;daily business&quot; such as the proposal and support of projects and the funding allocation to projects. The Ballot Vote provides a blockchain-based technical infrastructure to transparently propose and vote.</p>
<h3>Art. 6 Underlying Technology</h3>
<p>FlatFeeStack DAO is technically built with Solidity Smart Contracts. All voting will take place on this technical infrastructure. The relevant technical functions are hereinafter written in italic. To be able to vote, holding a certain amount of crypto currency is necessary for every member (transaction fees, gas fees).</p>
<h3>Art. 7 Council Member (Vorstand)</h3>
<p>FlatFeeStack DAO has at minimum 2 council members with the following competencies and duties:</p>
<ol>
<li>Representing FlatFeeStack DAO to the outside world.</li>
<li>Managing financial records and creating the necessary financial statements of FlatFeeStack DAO.</li>
<li>Canceling a Ballot Vote with exactly 2 Council Member signatures, if the council has good reason (<code>councilCancel</code>).</li>
<li>Executing contract calls on official orders by governmental authorities with exactly 2 Council Member signatures (<code>councilExecute</code>).</li>
<li>Reviewing member applicants on their eligibility to join FlatFeeStack DAO. If the member meets the requirements of Art. 11, the Council Member will endorse the member by providing two council signatures. This authorization enables the new member to generate their membership non-fungible token (NFT) (<code>safeMint</code>).</li>
<li>Remove Members who haven't paid their membership fees (<code>burn</code>).</li>
<li>Keeping the member registry (name, address, e-mail).</li>
</ol>
<p>The term of office for the Council Member starts with the foundation of this FlatFeeStack DAO and ends when the Council Member has been replaced via a proposal.If a Council Member becomes unable to act or loses his private key, the Council Member or its address must be replaced with a new Council Member in the next Ballot Vote. If all the Council Members are unable to act, an new Ballot Vote will be called and two new Council Members must be elected. The personal liability of a Council Member is limited to cases of gross negligence.</p>
<h3>Art. 8 Ballot Vote (&quot;Urabstimmung&quot;)</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Competences:
The Ballot Vote shall be the highest governing body of FlatFeeStack DAO. The objective of the Ballot Vote is to allow every member to propose new projects and to vote on proposals, such as the funding allocation to those projects. The Ballot Vote automatically collects all the votes on the proposals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Voting Process:
The voting process is digital and blockchain based.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Voting Majorities:
Proposals shall be adopted by a simple majority of the Members participating at the individual Ballot Vote. Vote participation is only considered for approving or abstaining votes. In case of 2 Members, a single vote is sufficient. For more than 2 Members, at least 2 votes are required to reach a majority, and the number of required votes is calculated as follows: min_votes = max(2, int(20% * total_members) / total_members), indicating a vote participating of ~14-20% (depending on rounding).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Election Process for Council Member:
Any member can propose themselves for candidacy as a Council Member (<code>propose</code> &amp; <code>setCouncil</code>). If the proposal is successful the new Council Member term starts at the execution of the proposal. Any member can also propose to remove a Council Member (<code>propose</code> &amp; <code>setCouncil</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Convocation:
The Ballot Vote starts with a proposal submitted in regular slots. The duration of a slot is 7 days. After one slot finishes, the next immediately begins. The voting process starts after one full slot finishes. There is no Ballot Vote in a slot if no proposal is submitted. The Council Member will inform the Members electronically on the date, which is 3 days prior to the slot end. A Ballot Vote lasts 1 day. Since every member can propose a Ballot Vote, no extraordinary Ballot Vote is necessary. After a successful vote, the execution gets queued until the end of the next slot.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Proposals &amp; Agenda Items:
Every member can submit a proposal. The contract execution via the Ballot Vote is binding and technically non-reversible – not even by the Council Member. However, at least 2 Council Member signatures can cancel a proposal before its execution, if they have a good reason.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Art. 11 Awareness of Technological &amp; Conceptual Risks</h3>
<p>Blockchain is a new technology. The technical or conceptual structure of this FlatFeeStack DAO and the voting process may have weaknesses, as it is the case with every blockchain project. Moreover, the FlatFeeStack DAO is dependent on the underlying Blockchain protocol.

Every member explicitly declares to be aware of and to agree to those risks.</p>

<h2>Update &amp; Dissolution</h2>
<h3>Art. 20 Update of the Underlying Code</h3>
<p>The FlatFeeStack DAO's smart contract cannot be updated directly. However, deploying a new DAO smart contract allows existing NFT memberships to be counted under this new contract, with any transfer of remaining assets subject to a Ballot Vote.</p>
<p>To amend the bylaws of the FlatFeeStack DAO, it's necessary to update the SHA256 hash in the DAO's smart contract. This process additionally mandates a Ballot Vote for approval (<code>setNewBylawsHash</code>).</p>
<h3>Art. 21 Dissolution &amp; Liquidation</h3>
<p>The dissolution of FlatFeeStack DAO can be adopted with a proposal (<code>propose</code>, <code>pause</code>). Any remaining funds need to be transferred to one of the Council Members (specified in the proposal), who must carry out the liquidation process. If no Council Members are active, the funds can be transferred to a Member.</p>
