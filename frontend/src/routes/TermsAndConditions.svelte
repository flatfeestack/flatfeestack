  <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

  <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    Welcome to our open-source donation platform. By using this platform, you
    agree to the following terms and conditions, which govern your access to and
    use of the platform, as well as your participation in any donation
    activities related to open-source projects. Our platform enables users to
    donate to open-source Git repositories, with an option to apply a multiplier
    to speciﬁc repositories. This means that when a user donates to a project,
    the foundation/user will donate based on a predeﬁned rule (see source code).
  </p>
  <p>
    By using our platform, you agree to these Terms and acknowledge the
    associated guidelines and restrictions.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Platform Usage</h3>
  <ul>

    <li>
      By creating an account on the platform, users agree to act in good faith
      when donating to open-source repositories.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3. Multiplier Feature</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      A foundation or any user may choose to apply a multiplier to speciﬁc Git
      repositories. When a multiplier is active, the foundation/user will donate
      based on a predeﬁned rule (see source code) and the donation made to that
      project by a user.
    </li>
    <li>
      Users are prohibited from any fraudulent activities intended to exploit
      the multiplier system, including but not limited to:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Self-donating: Developers or project maintainers are not permitted to
          donate to their own repositories with the intent of receiving funds
          from the foundation/user.
        </li>
        <li>
          Collusion: Users must not conspire with others to falsely inﬂate
          donations with the goal of beneﬁting from the multiplier.

      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4. Fraudulent Activities</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>

      donation process for personal gain. This includes:
    </li>
    <li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Creating multiple accounts to falsely increase the amount donated to a
          speciﬁc repository.
        </li>
        <li>
          Donating to repositories in which they have a direct ﬁnancial
          interest, with the intent of abusing the multiplier feature.
